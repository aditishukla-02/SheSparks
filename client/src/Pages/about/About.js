        Welcome to our platform, a dedicated space for women's empowerment, safety, and awareness. Our mission is to create a world where every woman feels secure, informed, and empowered to take control of her life.

Developed by Aditi Shukla, this website provides real-time incident tracking, state-wise analysis, and insightful blog posts to raise awareness and inspire change. We also offer a curated list of NGOs actively working towards women's rights, safety, and development, making it easier for individuals to seek help and contribute to the cause.

By leveraging technology and community-driven data, we aim to bridge the gap between information, action, and support. Together, we can build a safer and more empowered society for women.

Join us in making a difference! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
